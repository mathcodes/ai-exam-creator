## General Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of creating a prompt that will generate the desired output from a language model.
 - creating a prompt that will lead the model to generate the desired output.

The goal of prompt engineering is to create a prompt that will lead the model to generate the desired output.
 - The desired output is a question and answer pair.
 - The prompt is a passage of text that contains the answer to the question.
 - The model is a language model that can generate text conditioned on a prompt.


## Prompt Injection Leaks or Attacks Expained

Prompt injection attacks are a type of attack that can be used to steal information from a language model.
 - The attacker injects a prompt into the model and then uses the model to generate text.
 - The attacker can then use the generated text to steal information from the model.

The problem with prompt injection attacks is that they are very difficult to detect.
 - The attacker can inject a prompt into the model and then use the model to generate text.
 - The attacker can then use the generated text to steal information from the model.
